# Selvet

This project is supposed to be a compiler similar to svelte, compiling typed code into WASM.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Basic emitting of WASM code as a hello world of compilers
- [ ] read basic functions from an input file, emit simple unoptimized WASM
- [ ] Setup testing
- [ ] Write basic tests
- [ ] Specify a formal grammar for the language
- [ ] Design an SSA IR between the source language and WASM
- [ ] Implement basic compilation of functions from IR to WASM
- [ ] Implement structs and dynamic memory
- [ ] Layout the runtime which has to be implemented in JS at the moment
- [ ] Implement a minimal example of reactive UI in the IR
- [ ] Implement a compiler that compiles the source language to SSA IR
- [ ] Swifty class like structures with methods in the frontend
- [ ] Basic component compilation
- [ ] If Clauses in templates
- [ ] Each clauses in templates
- [ ] Slots
- [ ] More svelte features
